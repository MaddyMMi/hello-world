# About Me
My name is Maddy Michaelides, and I am a second semester student in the MLIS program. I also work in Memorial Library as a Cataloging Assistant and a Monograph Acquisitions assistant. 
## Interests
I am interested in a career in Cataloging and Technical Services at an academic library. I really enjoy working with metadata and working behind the scenes with bibliographic records. I also would be open to working in publishing again and working with digital materials at an academic publishing press like UChicago's (https://press.uchicago.edu/index.html).
## Tools/Methods
I am most interested in learning more about different software that can be used to analyze or work with texts. I am interested in learning more about the kinds of projects or reasons why academic librarians may use or rely on Git or Github in a professional context. Similarly, I am open to learning more about the kinds of humanities work that is being done using different software.
